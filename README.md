# Checkin 1

* Created the solution folder and added the necessary projects in it. <br>

* started working on library project with data models and the rquired classes. The library project has some test cases with it.<br>

* Unit test has been started and some of the test cases was present as you see on the commits.<br>

* I'm using both the webAPI and WebUI projects and started working on it, the WebAPI contains the Home Controller to validate the user.
The WebUI contain the views and the vewModels in it.<br>

* Integration test has been setup and some test cases were present on it for the login page and the register page, I'M using pycharm for my integration test.<br>

* [Note: readme file was deleted while i'm pushing my code today(April 11) so i need to update it again.]

# Checkin 2

* Added migrations, Login, register and user management was done via scaffolding, but I customized to have first name and last name stored as well.<br>

* My initial idea is to use firebase, but since it took too long I decided to go with the ASP.NET with idenity approach, since razorpages were quite straightforward and takes less time since there is easy support for easy scaffolding with entity framework.<br>

* All the quries are did in linq query to get user details.<br>

* Data attributes added for classes, like [Required].<br>

* Added unit test for login pages where it test the user datails.<br>

# Checkin 3

* added more views and vew models in the webUI.<br>

* added integration test cases for most of the code and are tested using the pycharm.<br>

* Added ModelState.IsValid for server validation, added basic checks before CRUD operations.<br>

* Currently working on the comments that I get on previous checkin that using the IdentityDbContext for secure logins and trying to avoid the login models .<br>
